                <h1>Why I developed the BASA MAPUA?</h1>

                <p>BASA MAPUA, the student publication website, was born out of a vision to empower students by providing a 
                    centralized platform for staying informed and expressing themselves. As a student, I realized the need 
                    for a space where we could easily access institutional updates, stay in the loop about upcoming school 
                    events, and hone our journalism and writing skills. BASA MAPUA not only serves as an information hub but 
                    also as a creative outlet, allowing students to showcase their original writing and share their thoughts 
                    on a safe freedom wall. The word censoring feature ensures a respectful and inclusive environment for all 
                    users. This project was developed with a deep commitment to fostering a sense of community, encouraging 
                    critical thinking, and promoting transparency within our educational institution.</p>
